# Price Feed Script for BitShares

## Installation 

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

Start the installation

```
cd ~
pip3 install bitshares-pricefeed --user
```

Create config.yml
```
bitshares-pricefeed create
```

Add a feed producer name to the config.yml file just created
```
vim config.yml
# The producer name(s)
producer: your_witness_name
```

Enter Credentials

```
bitshares-pricefeed addkey
```

You will need to enter your cli wallet encryption passphrase. If you
don't have a pybitshares wallet, yet, one will be created:

```
Wallet Encryption Passphrase:
Repeat for confirmation:
```

You will need to enter your Private Key (Active key) here. Hit enter the second time it asks you.

```

```

Manually run the feed update

```
bitshares-pricefeed update
```

Create a place for a logfile

```
sudo touch /var/log/bitshare-pricefeed.log
sudo chown ubuntu /var/log/bitshare-pricefeed.log
```

Add to cron, where PASSWD is your Wallet Encryption Passphrase. This logic will send stdin and sterr to the logfile.

```
$ crontab -e

SHELL=/bin/bash
